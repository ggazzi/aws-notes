		- [[AWS/Public vs. Private Services]]
			- Doesn't refer to permissions, but to networking
			- Private services are located inside a [[AWS/VPC]] and needs an [[AWS/Internet Gateway]] to communicate with public AWS services and the public internet.
				- VPC -> AWS public zone doesn't need to go through the public internet!
			- An [[AWS/VPC]] is a private network within the AWS infrastructure, completely isolated unless configured otherwise.
			- AWS also has a "public zone", which is a private network connected to the public internet. Public services are located here, and are accessible directly from the public internet.
		- Global infrastructure
			- AWS has bits of infrastructure spread throughout the world.
			- [[AWS/Region]]: an area of the world with one or more AWS data centers containing a full deployment of AWS services
				- Regions are geographically spread and independent from each other, but connected to each other via high-speed links
				- Has a code (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`) and a name (e.g., Asia Pacific (Sydney))
				- Services are separate in each region
				- Overview page: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/
				- Advantages when designing:
					- isolated fault domains due to geographic separation
					- different governance due to geopolitical separation
					- performance tuning via location control
				- Each region provides one or more [Availability Zones]([[AWS/Availability Zone]])
					- Each availability zone has separate resources from the others
					- Placing components in separate AZs adds fault tolerance
					- A single [[AWS/VPC]] can span multiple AZs, linking together components from separate places.
					- Each zone may be one or more data centers
			- [[AWS/Edge Location]]: a local distribution point with a subset of AWS services, enabling lower latency for local customers
			- Resilience
				- [Globally resilient]([[AWS/Global Resilience]]) services are spread/replicated throughout multiple regions.
					- Failure of a region will not cause failure of the service
					- It would take a multi-region/global failure to take the service down
				- [Reginally resilient]([[AWS/Region Resilience]]) services operate independently in each region
					- Failure of the region will cause failure of the service
					- Usually replicated across AZs, so failure of one AZ will not cause failure of the service
				- [AZ resilient]([[AWS/AZ Resiliency]]) services operate independently in each AZ
					- Failures of an AZ will cause failures of the service
		- [[AWS/VPC]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- A virtual network inside AWS, within 1 [[AWS/Account]] and 1 [[AWS/Region]]
				- So it is [regionally resilient]([[AWS/Region Resilience]])
				- You could delete the default VPC, but some services will not work without it.
					- You can recreate the default VPC if you delete it
			- Private and isolated by default, _except_ for the default VPC
				- There is exactly one default VPC per region, which have a fixed configuration managed by AWS
				- You can add arbitrarily many Custom VPCs and configure them however you want
			- Each VPC has a range of addresses, presented in [[CIDR]] notation
				- You can have subnets of the VPC on each AZ
			- Configuration of the default VPC:
				- Address range `172.31.0.0/16`
				- One `/20` subnet for each AZ, each with its own address range (so you can have 16 AZs max)
				- [[AWS/Internet Gateway]] to communicate with public internet
				- [[AWS/Security Group]] and Network ACL (NACL)
				- Public IPv4 addresses for every service deployed in it.
			- Best practice: don't use default VPC for deployments
		- [[AWS/Elastic Compute Cloud]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- Default compute service
			- Provides virtual machines, known as instances
			- It's [[IAAS]], so unit of consumption is a virtual machine/instance
			- It's a private service located within a single [[AWS/VPC]]
				- So public access needs to be configured if desired
			- Instances are [AZ resilient]([[AWS/AZ Resiliency]])
			- Instances are configurable in terms of size and capabilities
				- Some of this can be changed after launching instance
			- You need to manage everything from the OS upwards
			- On-demand billing /s or /h, with separate rates/charges for
				- CPU and memory consumption
				- Storage
				- Extra commercial software being used
			- Storage options:
				- Local on-host storage
				- [[AWS/Elastic Block Store]]: network storage media
			- State attribute
			  collapsed:: true
				- Influences costs
				- Options
					- Running
						- Ongoing charges for CPU, memory, storage and network
					- Stopped
						- Can be restarted and go back to running
						- Ongoing charges for storage only
						- CPU, memory and network not used, so no costs
					- Terminated: instance no longer exists, was deleted, non-reversible
						- No ongoing charges
					- there are others, mostly transitional
				- State influences cost
			- You can connect to instances for shell access
				- Windows host: via RDP, port 3389
				- Linux instance: via SSH, port 22, with key pair
		- [[AWS/Amazon Machine Image]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- Essentially a server image for EC2 instances
			- Can be used to create an EC2 instance, or can be created from an EC2 instance
			- Has permission control for who is allowed to create EC2 instances from the AMI
				- Private: only owner
				- Public: every account
				- Owner can give explicit permission to specific accounts
			- Contains a boot volume, and potentially more volumes
			- Block Device Mapping: determines how the OS will see the volumes
		- [[AWS/Simple Storage Service]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- Almost all other services interact with S3
			- It's a global, [public service]([[AWS/Public vs. Private Services]])
			- It is [regionally resilient]([[AWS/Region Resilience]]), so the data is stored in a specific [[AWS/Region]] and is replicated in the AZs
				- It can be configured to replicate between regions
			- Supports unlimited amounts of data and multiple users
			- Good for small to large amounts of data
			- Very cheap
			- Multiple ways to access it
			- Best default storage option
			- [[AWS/Simple Storage Service/Object]]
				- Essentially a file.
				- Uniquely identified by an [[S3 Bucket]] and a key (a string, similar to a filename)
				- Contains a value, up to 5TB of data #exam-powerup
				- Also have:
					- Version ID
					- Metadata
					- Access COntrol
					- Subresources
			- [[AWS/Simple Storage Service/Bucket]]
				- Created in a specific [[AWS/Region]]
					- Data from a bucket never leaves the region by default
				- Bucket names must be **globally unique**, across all regions and AWS accounts, and follow certain [naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html) #exam-powerup
					- 3-63 characters, all lowercase, no underscore
					- start with lowercase letter or number
					- can't be IP formatted
					- among others
				- Soft limit of 100 buckets, hard limit of 1000 buckets #exam-powerup
					- Dynamic creation of buckets isn't feasible
					- Use one bucket with prefixes instead
				- Can hold an unlimited number of [objects]([[S3 Object]])
				- It has a **flat structure**, unlike a filesystem
					- Usually, they have folders (or prefixes) by naming convention. This is purely handled in the UI, _not_ part of the underlying data
				- Object store, not file or block (can't be mounted as a drive)
				- Good for "offloading" data, as it's cheap
				- Often used as input and/or output to other AWS products
				- Buckets are private by default: only accessible within the account, by root/admin users
				- You can block all public access to the bucket as a failsafe
					- Won't allow it even if you give public permissions
				- Each bucket gets a unique [[ARN]] with the format `arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>`
				- Deleting a bucket requires emptying it first
	- [[AWS/CloudFormation]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- It's an [[Infrastructure as Code]] product
		- Automates creation, update and deletion of infrastructure
		- It's based on stacks: collections of logical resources
			- CloudFormation ensures each logical resource of a stack has exactly one matching physical resource
			- Similar to virtual DOM in JS frontend frameworks
		- Stacks are created from templates written in YAML or JSON
		- Template contains
			- Resources (only mandatory part)
				- Determines what to do, changes to this require actions
				- Called _logical resources_
				- Contain a type and properties, see the [reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)
					- Can use CFN functions to determine property values
			- Description: free text, documentation
				- If `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` exists, description must come right after it #exam-powerup
			- Metadata
				- Some of the metadata can used to control the UI in the AWS console
			- Parameters: fields that users must provide when using the template
				- They'll be prompted for it
				- One useful type of parameter: latest AMI ID to keep OS image up to date
			- Mappings
				- Lookup tables to help with parameterized templates
			- Conditions
				- Declares a boolean condition
				- Can then be used within resources
			- Outputs: values that should be presented after the template is applied
				- Uses CFN functions to get the data
		-
	- [[AWS/CloudWatch]]
		- Support for other services
		- Collects and manages operational data
		- [[AWS/CloudWatch/Metrics]] : collection, monitoring, visualization and actions based on metrics
			- A metric is: a time-ordered set of datapoints
				- a datapoint has a timestamp and a value, usually numeric
				- datapoints can be organized in **dimensions**: key-value pairs providing context
					- examples: Name=InstanceId Value=asdfas; Name=InstanceType Value=p1.micro
			- Native metrics from AWS
			- Collects metrics from logs via [[EMF]]
			- You can add metrics via CloudWatch Agent (either from outside the AWS or "inside" resources)
		- [[AWS/CloudWatch/Logs]]: collection, monitoring, access and actions based on logs
			- Native logs from AWS
			- Extra logs can be added with CloudWatch Agent
		- [[AWS/CloudWatch/Events]]
			- Can react to events coming from other AWS products
			- Can schedule events/actions based on time
		- Provides [[AWS/CloudWatch/Alarms]]
			- Each alarm is linked to a specific metric
			- Configured to determine what states are OK and what states are not, based on the metric
			- Each alarm can be in one of three states:
				- OK
				- Alarm
				- Insufficient data: depending on configuration, treated as OK or Alarm
			- When the alarm is triggered, it can report to SNS or some other action
		- Provides statistics on the Console and via API
		- [[AWS/CloudWatch/Namespace]]: named collection of metrics
			- Native data goes to AWS/_service_ namespaces, such as AWS/EC2
