	- [[AWS/Shared Responsibility Model]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Responsibility over the technical stack is shared between AWS and the customer.
		- Particularly important for security concerns:
			- AWS is responsible for security _of_ the cloud
				- Hardware and [[AWS/Global Infrastructure]]
				- Compute, storage, database and networking resources
				- Software provided by AWS (web console, hypervisor...)
			- Customer is responsible for security _in_ the cloud
				- Server-side data encryption
				- Client-side data encryption, integrity and authentication
				- Networking traffic protection: encryption, integrity, authentication/identity
				- OS, Network and Firewall configuration
				- Applications, including identity and access management
				- Customer data
	- [[High Availability]] vs. [[Fault Tolerance]] vs. [[Disaster Recovery]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- [[High Availability]]
			- TLDR: minimise any outages
			- _Ensure_ an agreed level of operational _performance_, usually _uptime_, for a higher than normal period
				- Not about the UX, transient failures can occur, as long as the system recovers quickly enough
			- Requires automated recovery methods, humans cannot react quickly enough to ensure such a high level of uptime
			- Achieving this incurs additional costs
			- Great analogy: driving through the desert. You need to have extra tires and tools to replace a flat tire. You'll have to stop to do it, but as long as you can replace it quickly and continue the trip, you'll be ok.
		- [[Fault Tolerance]]
			- TLDR: operate through faults
			- System can operate successfully even in the present of [faults]([[Fault]]), without disruptions
			- This is stricter than [[High Availability]], therefore more complex and much more costly
			- Great analogy: flying an airplane. You cannot stop mid-flight to fix/swap components, so the airplane *must* continue operating even if a component fails.
		- [[Disaster Recovery]]
			- TLDR: plan for when [[High Availability]] and [[Fault Tolerance]] don't work
			- Policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster
			- Involves a lot of pre-planning: during a disaster, it's hard to come up with good solutions. It's better to think about these scenarios in advance and, when they happen, already know what to do
			- Involves backup storage and infrastructure
		- [[AWS/Route 53]]
			- Two services:
				- registering domains
				- hosting zones: managed nameservers
			- It's a [globally resilient]([[AWS/Global Resilience]]) service, with a single global database
			- Relations with the main domain registrars, allowing registrations of domains
			- When registering a domain, it does:
				- Checks with the registrar whether the domain is available
				- Creates a [[Zone File]] for this domain
				- Sets up name servers with this zone file, throughout the world
				- Sends NS (name server) records to the top-level domain
			- [[AWS/Route 53/Hosted Zones]]
				- Allows the creation and management of [zone files]([[Zone File]])
				- These are hosted on four managed name servers
				- Visibility:
					- public: accessible from the public internet, part of the global DNS system
					- private: accessible only inside specific [VPCs]([[AWS/VPC]])
				- Stores records (recordsets).
					- What's a recordset and how is it different from a zone file? #question
	- [[DNS/Record]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Can have a [[TTL]] value (measured in seconds), used by other DNS servers that cache this record
			- It's a "promise" by the authoritative server that this record will not change for a given amount of time, so other servers can safely cache this record during this time.
			- During the TTL of a record, other servers can provide the record as non-authoritative answers
			- Picking a TTL value is a tradeoff between cost of DNS lookups and the ease of modifying DNS records
		- [[DNS/Record/NS]]: nameserver records
			- Allow delegation to occur
			- Multiple NS records can exist for the same domain, within a single zone
			- The name server is identified with a hostname, not an IP address!
			- Example: the .com zone can contain the following
				- amazon.com NS pdns1.ultradns.net
				- amazon.com NS pdns6.ultradns.co.uk
		- [[DNS/Record/A]] and [[DNS/Record/AAAA]]: map hostnames to IP addresses
			- A maps to IPv4 addresses
			- AAAA maps to IPv6 addresses
			- Usually, you'll only have one A and one AAAA record for each hostname in a zone
		- [[DNS/Record/CNAME]]: Canonical Name
			- DNS "symlinks": map a hostname to another hostname
				- Does the target have to be in the same zone? #question
			- Used to reduce admin overhead when a single server handles multiple different things
		- [[DNS/Record/MX]]
			- Important for email
			- Have two fields: a priority (number) and a hostname
				- Hostnames without a `.` are implicitly part of the same zone
				- Hostnames with a `.` are fully qualified
			- Example:
				- In the google.com zone, the following two entries
					- MX 10 mail
					- MX 20 mail.other.domain
				- An SMTP server want to send an email to `foo@google.com`
				- It performs an MX query at `google.com`
				- It should use the entry with lowest priority value first.
			- How exactly is the priority of MX records used? #question
		- [[DNS/Record/TXT]]
			- Stores arbitrary text in a DNS record, allowing "extensibility" for DNS
			- Example usage: prove to an external party that we own a domain
				- The external party gives us an arbitrary piece of text
				- We add a TXT entry with that piece of text
				- The party queries our domain for TXT and finds their expected text
	- [[AWS/IAM/Policy]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Get attached to [identities]([[AWS/IAM/Identity]]) to either ALLOW or DENY access to AWS resources
		- A policy is a set of security statements, written in JSON
		- Every interaction with AWS is an [[AWS/Action]] being applied to an [[AWS/Resource]].
		- Policy Is composed of:
			- Statement ID or `"Sid"`. Mostly for documentation, best practice is to always use it.
			- Effect: `"allow"` or `"deny"`
			- Action: a list of [[AWS/Action]]s, potentially including wildcards
			- Resource: a list of resources identified as [[ARN]]s, potentially including wildcards
		- Used by AWS after [[Authentication]], to decide on [[Authorization]]
			- AWS collects all statements for all the policies attached to a particular identity, _directly or indirectly_
				- For example: a user may have their own policies, but also policies from a group they're a member of
			- It will filter the statements that match the desired action and target resource
			- Access will be granted if and only if there's at least one allow-statement and no deny-statements
				- No statements => denied
				- Only allow statements => allowed
				- Only deny statements => denied
				- Both allow and deny statements => denied
		- Two main types of policies: inline and managed policies
			- The format is the same, the difference is on how they're handled
			- Inline policies are stored together with the target identity. They cannot be reused.
			- Managed policies are stored as their own object, and can be explicitly attached to multiple identities.
				- They enable DRY
			- Best practice: use managed policies for the normal operational rights, inline policies only for special/exceptional cases
	- [[AWS/IAM/User]]
		- Starts with a Principal (e.g. person or application) that wants to interact with IAM resources
			- First step: [[Authentication]]. The principal proves to IAM that they are who they claim they are
				- Either with username and password, or with access keys
				- At this point, the principal becomes an authenticated identity
			- An authenticated identity can interact with resources, as long as it can pass [[Authorization]]
		- Has a specific [[ARN]]
		- Important limitations with design impacts: #exam-powerup
			- Maximum of 5000 IAM Users per [[AWS/Account]]
			- Maximum of 10 [groups]([[AWS/IAM/Group]]) per user
			- Thus, IAM users are not suitable for internet-scale applications or large orgs
			- Alternatives are [roles]([[AWS/IAM/Role]]) and [[Identity Federation]]
