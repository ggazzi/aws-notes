- A special [[Identity]] created for every [[AWS Account]].
- Has permission to do everything with the account.
- Using a strong password and MFA for this account is critical for [[Security]].
- Should not be used on day-to-day operations, other identities should be created for that.
	- Good practice: having an admin identity with full permissions. If the admin identity gets compromised, the root user can replace it.
